/* Engine.js
 * This file provides the game loop functionality (update entities and render),
 * draws the initial game board on the screen, and then calls the update and
 * render methods on your player and enemy objects (defined in your app.js).
 *
 * A game engine works by drawing the entire game screen over and over, kind of
 * like a flipbook you may have created as a kid. When your player moves across
 * the screen, it may look like just that image/character is moving or being
 * drawn but that is not the case. What's really happening is the entire "scene"
 * is being drawn over and over, presenting the illusion of animation.
 *
 * This engine is available globally via the Engine variable and it also makes
 * the canvas' context (ctx) object globally available to make writing app.js
 * a little simpler to work with.
